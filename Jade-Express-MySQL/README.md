# Jade_Express_MySQL

This is a 'traditional' web app using MySQL / Express / Jade

The code was built in VS2013 with Node.js Tools installed, but should port to any other IDE.
The project build process uses gulp  

The vagrant file maps this project folder to /vagrant on the VM.

The application appears at http://10.10.10.20/ . The VM uses host-only networking - a network that is private to your host and the guest machines on that host.
